Adaptive Power Line Interference Canceller
=================================

The source code of a fast and robust algorithm for removal of power line interference from biomedical signals.
The provided MATLAB .m file is the implementation of the proposed algorithm in:
**Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran and Zhi Yang, "A Fast, Robust Algorithm for Power Line Interference Cancellation in Neural Recording", Journal of Neural Engineering 11 026017, available at http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/11/2/026017**

If you find this program useful in your research, please give credit by citing the above paper. If you have any question regarding the algorithm or implementation, do not hesitate to write to the authors at one of the following addresses: keshtkaran AT ieee.org, keshtkaran AT nus.edu.sg

You need MATLAB software to use this program. 

For User Guide, please refer to "removePLI.m" or type "help removePLI" in the MATLAB command prompt.
The MATLAB script "test_removePLI.m" runs the algorithm on sample intracortical, ECoG, EEG and ECG signals.
Please refer to "remove_PLI_multichan.m" for an optimized implementation for multichannel data.

## Usage
For Graphical User Interface:
```
>> remove_PLI_gui
```
For running from the command line:
```
>> s = removePLI_multichan(x, fs, M, B, P, W, f_ac, freqChan)
```
```
  x, input (contaminated) signal
  s, output (clean) signal
  fs, sample rate in Hz
  M, number of harmonics to remove
  B, contains three elements [B0,Binf,Bst]: 
	- B0, Initial notch bandwidth of the frequency estimator
	- Binf, Asymptotic notch bandwidth of the frequency estimator
	- Bst, Rate of convergence to 95% of the asymptotic bandwidth Binf
  P, contains three elements [P0,Pinf,Pst]: 
	- P0, Initial settling time of the frequency estimator
	- Pinf, Asymptotic settling time of the frequency estimator
	- Pst, Rate of convergence to 95% of the asymptotic settling time
  W, Settling time of the amplitude and phase estimator
  f_ac, Optional argument, the nominal AC frequency if known (50 Hz or 60 HZ)
  freqChan, Optional argument, The channel number to be used for frequency
     estimation. []: use the first channel (default), 0: Perform frequency
     estimation indivisually for all the channels (similar to removePLI)
```
```
  EXAMPLE:
		fs = 500;
		n = 60*fs; %1-min sequence	
		m = 10; %number of channels
		t = 2*pi*(1:n)/fs;
		fline = 60 + randn; %ramdom interference frequency
		s = filter(1,[1,-0.99],100*randn(n,m))'; %1/f PSD
		p = bsxfun(@times,sin(fline*t+randn), (80+5*randn(m,1))) ...
          + bsxfun(@times,sin(2*fline*t+randn), (50+5*rand(m,1))) ...
		  + bsxfun(@times,sin(3*fline*t+randn), (20+5*randn(m,1))); % interference	
		x = s + p;
 		sbar = removePLI_multichan(x, fs, 3, [50,0.01,4], [0.1,2,4], 2);
 		pwelch(s(1,:),[],[],[],fs); title('PSD of the original signal')
 		figure; pwelch(x(1,fs:end),[],[],[],fs); 
		title('PSD of the contaminated signal');
 		figure; pwelch(sbar(1,fs:end),[],[],[],fs); 
		title('PSD after interference cancellation');
